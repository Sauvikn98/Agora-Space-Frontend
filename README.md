## Agora Space

Agora Space is an online platform for users to connect to people worldwide and share thoughts and ideas.  

## Project Overview

In the forum app, we will have signed-up users. And users can create spaces(groups) among themselves. In spaces, users can creat posts and comment on posts. Users can upvote and downvote posts. There will be a home page, where users will be redirected after signing in or signup. On the dashboard, there will be recent posts of the current userâ€™s spaces that he/she has joined.
